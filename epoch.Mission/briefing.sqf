Groupmenu: Inventorykey and lower left is the Groupmenu.<br/><br/>

Some vehicles may explode or despawn after restarts. Park vehicles away from buildings and other vehicles!<br/><br/>

When you die, your Krypto/Money will fall to the ground in the form of an iPhone. It's small so look closely to find it!<br/><br/>

1-3 minutes before restart, you should logout to prevent character and inventory loss!<br/><br/>
